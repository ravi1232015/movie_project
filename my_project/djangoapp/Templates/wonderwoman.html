<h3>The trailer also debuts Wonder Woman's brand new suit of armour (far more practical for fighting baddies, if you ask us) and swathes of 1980s pop-culture iconography, including New Order's 'Blue Monday' playing throughout â€“ and plenty of shoulder pads.

A TV spot was released in the United States on January 19, but the footage is the same as in the feature length trailer, just in a slightly different order (sorry to disappoint). But it did seem to hype up American football fans, who were (according to their positive-but-surprised Twitter responses) seemingly unaware the movie was coming.</h3>
